Built on codeigniter v2 and used with php v5.7. It should work with older versions of php but would probably need some updating to get it to work with newer versions.

## Project Requirements

- users needed to be created by admin
- All need to be protected, no public area of site
- All client data is viewable by superAdmin only
- Frontend design must be reponsive to phones, tablets and desktop

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
